# Vocabulary Learning Project

## Overview
This project is designed to facilitate vocabulary learning by organizing words and phrases into a structured directory system. The repository contains two main folders: one for individual words and another for phrases and fixed expressions. Each folder is further divided into subdirectories to support a spaced repetition learning schedule over a week.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **words/**: Contains individual words for learning.
  - **day_1/**: Words to be studied on Day 1.
  - **day_2/**: Words to be studied on Day 2.
  - **day_3/**: Words to be studied on Day 3.
  - **day_4/**: Words to be studied on Day 4.
  - **day_5/**: Words to be studied on Day 5.
  - **day_6/**: Words to be studied on Day 6.
  - **day_7/**: Words to be studied on Day 7.

- **phrases/**: Contains phrases and fixed expressions for learning.
  - **day_1/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 1.
  - **day_2/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 2.
  - **day_3/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 3.
  - **day_4/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 4.
  - **day_5/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 5.
  - **day_6/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 6.
  - **day_7/**: Phrases to be studied on Day 7.

## Purpose
The structure is designed to support a spaced repetition system, where learners review different sets of words or phrases each day of the week. This approach helps reinforce vocabulary retention by organizing study material into daily chunks.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `words` or `phrases` folder based on what you want to study.
2. Select the subdirectory corresponding to the current day (e.g., `day_1` for Day 1).
3. Review the words or phrases listed in the files within the selected day's folder.
4. Repeat the process daily, moving to the next day's folder, to follow the spaced repetition schedule.

## Notes
- Each day's folder contains files in `.md` format listing the words or phrases for that day.
- Users can customize the content of each folder by adding, removing, or updating words and phrases as needed.
- The system assumes a 7-day cycle, but users can adapt it to their preferred schedule.
